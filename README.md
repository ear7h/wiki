# wiki

Code and files supporting a personal wiki.

It's not much right now, but the core of this is the graph database. Also
implemented is a small command line utility for turning any process that
accepts piped input into a shell; the utility is called mkshell. It does
not currently do anything more than `cat` but all of the hard stuff is
complete.
